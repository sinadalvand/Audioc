## Why AudioC?

**macOS automatically switches audio input and output to new devices (like headphones or AirPods) as soon as they're connected‚Äîeven if you prefer to use your MacBook's mic or speakers for certain tasks.**

AudioC gives you full control. Set your preferred input and output devices for every scenario. When you connect a new device, AudioC keeps things the way you want them‚Äîmusic on your MacBook speakers, voice through your headset, or any combination you choose.
